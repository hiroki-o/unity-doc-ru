!Transparent Shader Family

The Transparent shaders are used for fully- or semi-transparent objects.  Using the alpha channel of the ``Base`` texture, you can determine areas of the object which can be more or less transparent than others.  This can create a great effect for glass, HUD interfaces, or sci-fi effects.

[[shader-TransVertexLit| Attach:Shaders./Thumb-TransVertex.png]]

'''Assets needed:'''
* One ``Base`` texture with alpha channel for Transparency Map

!! [[shader-TransDiffuse|Transparent Diffuse]]

[[shader-TransDiffuse| Attach:Shaders./Thumb-TransDiffuse.png]]

'''Assets needed:'''
* One ``Base`` texture with alpha channel for Transparency Map

[[shader-TransDiffuse | &#187; More details]]


!! [[shader-TransSpecular|Transparent Specular]]

[[shader-TransSpecular| Attach:Shaders./Thumb-TransSpec.png]]

'''Assets needed:'''
* One ``Base`` texture with alpha channel for combined Transparency Map/Specular Map

'''Note:'''
One limitation of this shader is that the ``Base`` texture's alpha channel doubles as a Specular Map for the Specular shaders in this family.

!! [[shader-TransBumpedDiffuse|Transparent Normal mapped]]

[[shader-TransBumpedDiffuse| Attach:Shaders./Thumb-TransBump.png]]

'''Assets needed:'''
* One ``Base`` texture with alpha channel for Transparency Map
* One ``Normal map`` normal map, no alpha channel required

!! [[shader-TransBumpedSpecular|Transparent Normal mapped Specular]]

[[shader-TransBumpedSpecular| Attach:Shaders./Thumb-TransBumpSpec.png]]

'''Assets needed:'''
* One ``Base`` texture with alpha channel for combined Transparency Map/Specular Map
* One ``Normal map`` normal map, no alpha channel required

'''Note:'''
One limitation of this shader is that the ``Base`` texture's alpha channel doubles as a Specular Map for the Specular shaders in this family.
