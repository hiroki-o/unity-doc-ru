!FastBloom

``Blooming`` is the optical effect where light from a bright source (such as a glint) appears to leak into surrounding objects. This image effect adds such a glow in a fast and optimized way. If you need more flexibility, try the more sophisticated [[script-Bloom|Bloom]] effect instead.

This bloom effect works especially well with [[HDR]] enabled scenes.
