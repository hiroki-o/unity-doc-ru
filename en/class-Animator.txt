!Animator Component

Any GameObject that has an avatar will also have an ``Animator`` component, which is the link between the character and its behavior.

The ``Animator`` component references an ``Animator Controller`` which is used for setting up behavior on the character. This includes setup for [[AnimationStateMachines|State Machines]], [[AnimationBlendTrees|Blend Trees]], and events to be controlled from script.
