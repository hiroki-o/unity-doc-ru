! Global Fog

The $$Global Fog$$ image effect creates camera-based exponential fog. All calculations are done in world space which makes it possible to have height-based fog modes that can be used for sophisticated effects (see example).

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
