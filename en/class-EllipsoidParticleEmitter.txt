! Ellipsoid Particle Emitter (Legacy)

The $$Ellipsoid Particle Emitter$$ spawns particles inside a sphere. Use the ``Ellipsoid`` property below to scale & stretch the sphere.

(:include comp-ParticleEmitterProps:)
||``Ellipsoid`` ||Scale of the sphere along X, Y, and Z that the particles are spawned inside. ||
||``MinEmitterRange`` ||Determines an empty area in the center of the sphere - use this to make particles appear on the edge of the sphere. ||


!!Details

Ellipsoid Particle Emitters (EPEs) are the basic emitter, and are included when you choose to add a $$Particle System$$ to your scene from ^^Components->Particles->Particle System^^.  You can define the boundaries for the particles to be spawned, and give the particles an initial velocity.  From here, use the [[class-ParticleAnimator|Particle Animator]] to manipulate how your particles will change over time to achieve interesting effects.

!!! Min Emitter Range

The ``Min Emitter Range`` determines the depth within the ellipsoid that particles can be spawned.  Setting it to 0 will allow particles to spawn anywhere from the center core of the ellipsoid to the outer-most range.  Setting it to 1 will restrict spawn locations to the outer-most range of the ellipsoid.
