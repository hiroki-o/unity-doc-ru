! Grass

The $$Paint Foliage$$ button Attach:TerrainGuide-PaintFoliageButton.png allows you to paint grass, rocks, or other decorations around the Terrain.  To paint grass, choose ^^Edit Details button->Add Grass Texture^^.  You don't need to create a mesh for grass, just a texture.

At this dialog, you can fine-tune the appearance of the grass with the following options:

||PROPS
||``Detail Texture`` ||The texture to be used for the grass. ||
||``Min Width`` ||Minimum width of each grass section in meters. ||
||``Max Width`` ||Maximum width of each grass section in meters. ||
||``Min Height`` ||Minimum height of each grass section in meters. ||
||``Max Height`` ||Maximum height of each grass section in meters. ||
||``Noise Spread`` ||The size of noise-generated clusters of grass. Lower numbers mean less noise. ||
||``Healthy Color`` ||Color of healthy grass, prominent in the center of ``Noise Spread`` clusters. ||
||``Dry Color`` ||Color of dry grass, prominent on the outer edges of ``Noise Spread`` clusters. ||
||``Grayscale Lighting`` ||If enabled, grass textures will not be tinted by any colored light shining on the Terrain. ||
||``Lightmap Factor`` ||How much the grass will be influenced by the Lightmap. ||
||``Billboard`` ||If checked, this grass will always rotate to face the main $$Camera$$. ||

After you've clicked the ^^Add^^ button, you'll see the grass appear selectable in the $$Inspector$$.

!! Painting Grass

Painting grass works the same as painting textures or trees.  Select the grass you want to paint, and paint right onto the Terrain in the $$Scene View$$

__Note:__When you have a brush selected, move your mouse over the Terrain in the Scene View and press ^^F^^.  This will center the Scene View over the mouse pointer position and automatically zoom in to the ``Brush Size`` distance.  This is the quickest & easiest way to navigate around your Terrain while creating it.

!! Editing Grass

To change any import parameters for a particular Grass Texture, select it choose ^^Edit Details button->Edit^^.  You can also double-click it.  You will then see the $$Edit Grass$$ dialog appear, and be able to adjust the parameters described above.

You'll find that changing a few parameters can make a world of difference.  Even changing the ``Max/Min Width`` and ``Height`` parameters can vastly change the way the grass looks, even with the same number of grass objects painted on the Terrain.
