Layers can be used to cast rays, render, or apply lighting to certain groups of objects only. You can choose the Layer in the [[class-GameObject|GameObject inspector]]. More information about how to use Layers can be found [[Layers | here]], while Tags are covered [[Tags | here]].

Tags are used to quickly find objects from scripts, utilizing the Tag name. When a new tag is added, you can choose it from the [[class-GameObject|GameObject]] tag popup.
