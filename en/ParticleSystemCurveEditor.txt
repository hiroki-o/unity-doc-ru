!Particle System Curve Editor
!!MinMax curves

Many of the properties in the particle system modules describe a change of a value with time. That change is described via $$MinMax Curves$$. 
These time-animated properties (for example  ``size`` and ``speed``), will have a pull down menu on the right hand side, where you can choose between:

``Constant``: The value of the property will not change with time, and will not be displayed in the $$Curve Editor$$

``Curve``: The value of the property will change with time based on the curve specified in the $$Curve Editor$$

``Random between constants``: The value of the property will be selected at random between the two constants

``Random between curves``: A curve will be generated at random between the min and the max curve, and the value of the property will change in time based on the generated curve

In the $$Curve Editor$$, the ''x''-axis spans time between 0 and the value specified by the ``Duration`` property, and the ''y''-axis represents the value of the animated property at each point in time. The range of the ''y''-axis can be adjusted in the number field in the upper right corner of the $$Curve Editor$$. The $$Curve Editor$$ currently displays all of the curves for a particle system in the same window.

Note that the "-" in the bottom-right corner will remove the currently selected curve, while the "+" will ''optimize'' it (that is make it into a parametrized curve with at most 3 keys). 

For animating properties that describe vectors in 3D space, we use the TripleMinMax Curves, which are simply curves for the x-,y-, and z- dimensions side by side, and it looks like this:

!!Managing many curves in the curve editor
To avoid cluttering in the $$Curve Editor$$, it is possible to toggle curves on and off, by clicking on them in the inspector. The Particle System Curve Editor can also be detached from the Inspector by right-clicking on the ``Particle System Curves`` title bar, after which you should see something like this:
