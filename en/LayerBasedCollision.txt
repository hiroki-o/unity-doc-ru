!Layer-Based Collision Detection.
In Unity 3.x we introduce Layer-Based collision detection, which is a way to make $$Game Objects$$ collide with another specific $$Game Objects$$ that are tied up to specific layers.

''Objects Colliding with their own layer.''

In the image above you can see 6 GameObjects, (3 planes, 3 cubes) and the "Collision Matrix" to the right that states which Objects can collide with which layer.
In the example, we have set the Collision Matrix in a way that only GameObjects that belong to same layers can collide.

!Setting GameObjects to detect Collisions Based on Layers.
# Select a layer your Game Objects will belong to

# Repeat 1 for each Game Object until you have finished assigning your Game Objects to the layers.
# Open the Physics Preference Panel by clicking on ^^Edit->Project Settings->Physics^^.
# Select which layers on the Collision Matrix will interact with the other layers by checking them.
