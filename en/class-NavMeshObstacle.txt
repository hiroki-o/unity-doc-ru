!Navmesh Obstacle

Fixed obstacles on a navmesh can be set up as part of the baking process. However, it is also possible to have dynamic obstacles in a scene which will be avoided by agents as they move around. Such dynamic obstacles can be specified using the Navmesh Obstacle component. This can be added to any GameObject and will move as that object moves.
