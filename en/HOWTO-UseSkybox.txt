! How do I Make a Skybox?

A $$Skybox$$ is a 6-sided cube that is drawn behind all graphics in the game. Here are the steps to create one:

# Make 6 textures that correspond to each of the 6 sides of the skybox and put them into your project's $$Assets$$ folder.
# For each texture you need to change the wrap mode from ``Repeat`` to ``Clamp``. If you don't do this colors on the edges will not match up: [[<<]] Attach:SkyboxWrapmode.png
# Create a new $$Material$$ by choosing ^^Assets->Create->Material^^ from the menu bar.
# Select the shader drop-down in the top of the $$Inspector$$, choose ^^RenderFX->Skybox^^.
# Assign the 6 textures to each texture slot in the material. You can do this by dragging each texture from the $$Project View$$ onto the corresponding slots. [[<<]] Attach:SkyboxMaterial.png

To Assign the skybox to the scene you're working on:
# Choose ^^Edit->Render Settings^^ from the menu bar.
# Drag the new Skybox Material to the ``Skybox Material`` slot in the Inspector. [[<<]] Attach:SkyboxRenderSettings.png

Note that [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Standard Assets]] package contains several ready-to-use skyboxes - this is the quickest way to get started!
