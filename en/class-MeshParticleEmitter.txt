! Mesh Particle Emitter (Legacy)

The $$Mesh Particle Emitter$$ emits particles around a mesh. Particles are spawned from the surface of the mesh, which can be necessary when you want to make your particles interact in a complex way with objects.

!! Properties

||PROPS
(:include comp-ParticleEmitterProps:)
||``Interpolate Triangles`` ||If enabled, particles are spawned all over the mesh's surface. If disabled, particles are only spawned from the mesh's vertrices. ||
||``Systematic`` ||If enabled, particles are spawned in the order of the vertices defined in the mesh. Although you seldom have direct control over vertex order in meshes, most 3D modelling applications have a very systematic setup when using primitives. It is important that the mesh contains no faces in order for this to work. ||
||``Min Normal Velocity`` ||Minimum amount that particles are thrown away from the mesh. ||
||``Max Normal Velocity`` ||Maximum amount that particles are thrown away from the mesh. ||


!! Details

Mesh Particle Emitters (MPEs) are used when you want more precise control over the spawn position & directions than the simpler $$Ellipsoid Particle Emitter$$ gives you.  They can be used for making advanced effects.

MPEs work by emitting particles at the vertices of the attached mesh. Therefore, the areas of your mesh that are more dense with polygons will be more dense with particle emission.

!!Interpolate Triangles

Enabling your emitter to ``Interpolate Triangles`` will allow particles to be spawned between the mesh's vertices.  This option is off by default, so particles will only be spawned at the vertices.

Enabling this option will spawn particles on and in-between vertices, essentially all over the mesh's surface (seen below).

It bears repeating that even with ``Interpolate Triangles`` enabled, particles will still be denser in areas of your mesh that are more dense with polygons.


!! Systematic

Enabling ``Systematic`` will cause your particles to be spawned in your mesh's vertex order.  The vertex order is set by your 3D modeling application.

!! Normal Velocity

``Normal Velocity`` controls the speed at which particles are emitted along the normal from where they are spawned.

For example, create a Mesh Particle System, use a cube mesh as the emitter, enable ``Interpolate Triangles``, and set ``Normal Velocity Min`` and ``Max`` to 1. You will now see the particles emit from the faces of the cube in a straight line.

!! Hints

(:include comp-ParticleEmitterHints:)
* MPEs can also be used to make glow from a lot of lamps placed in a scene. Simply make a mesh with one vertex in the center of each lamp, and build an MPE from that with a halo material. Great for evil sci-fi worlds.
