||``Emit`` ||If enabled, the emitter will emit particles. ||
||``Min Size`` ||The minimum size each particle can be at the time when it is spawned. ||
||``Max Size`` ||The maximum size each particle can be at the time when it is spawned. ||
||``Min Energy`` ||The minimum lifetime of each particle, measured in seconds. ||
||``Max Energy`` ||The maximum lifetime of each particle, measured in seconds. ||
||``Min Emission`` ||The minimum number of particles that will be spawned every second. ||
||``Max Emission`` ||The maximum number of particles that will be spawned every second. ||
||``World Velocity`` ||The starting speed of particles in world space, along X, Y, and Z. ||
||``Local Velocity`` ||The starting speed of particles along X, Y, and Z, measured in the object's orientation. ||
||``Rnd Velocity`` ||A random speed along X, Y, and Z that is added to the velocity. ||
||``Emitter Velocity Scale`` ||The amount of the emitter's speed that the particles inherit. ||
||``Tangent Velocity`` ||The starting speed of particles along X, Y, and Z, across the Emitter's surface. ||
||``Angular Velocity`` ||The angular velocity of new particles in degrees per second.||
||``Rnd Angular Velocity`` ||A random angular velocity modifier for new particles.||
||``Rnd Rotation`` ||If enabled, the particles will be spawned with random rotations.||
||``Simulate In World Space`` ||If enabled, the particles don't move when the emitter moves. If false, when you move the emitter, the particles follow it around. ||
||``One Shot`` ||If enabled, the particle numbers specified by min & max emission is spawned all at once. If disabled, the particles are generated in a long stream. ||
