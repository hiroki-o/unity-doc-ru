!Noise

The $$Noise$$ image effect can simulate TV/VCR noise.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.

''Noise effect with high intensity applied to the scene''

||PROPS
||``Monochrome`` ||If enabled, Noise is similar to TV noise. If disabled, it more closely resembles VCR noise - it distorts color values in YUV space, so you also get hue changes, mostly towards magenta/green gues. ||
||``Grain Intensity Min/Max`` ||The intensity of noise takes random values between ``Min`` and ``Max``. ||
||``Grain Size`` ||The size of a single grain texture pixel in screen pixels. Increasing this will make noise grains larger. ||
||``Scratch Intensity Min/Max`` ||The intensity of additional scratch/dust takes random values between ``Min`` and ``Max``. ||
||``Scratch FPS`` ||Scratches jump to different positions on the screen at this framerate. ||
||``Scratch Jitter`` ||Scratches can jitter slightly while remaining close to their original positions. ||
