! Edge Detection

$$Edge Detect$$ image effect adds black edges to the image wherever color differences exceed some threshold.

If more sophisticated geometry-based edge detection is required, the Standard Assets also provide such a [[script-EdgeDetectEffectNormals | normals and depth-based edge detection]] effect.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.

||``Threshold`` ||Edges will be displayed wherever the color difference between neighboring pixels exceeds this value. Increasing the value will make edges less sensitive to texture or lighting changes. ||
