! Fisheye

The $$Fisheye$$ image effect creates distorts the image as if viewed through a fisheye lens (although any lens will distort the image to some extent).

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.

''Fisheye distorts the image at its corners. The use of [[script-AntialiasingAsPostEffect|image antialiasing techniques]] is highly recommended because of sampling artefacts.''
