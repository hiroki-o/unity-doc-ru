! Vortex

The $$Vortex$$ image effect distorts the rendered image within a circular region. Pixels in the image are displaced around a central circular area by a specified angle; the amount of displacement reduces with distance from the centre, diminishing to zero at the circle's edge. Vortex is similar to another image effect called [[script-TwirlEffect|Twirl]], although Twirl distorts the image around a point rather than a circle.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
