! Built-in state variables in shader programs

Often in [[SL-ShaderPrograms | shader programs]] you need to access some global state, for example, the current model*view*projection matrix, the current ambient color, and so on. There's no need to declare these variables for the built-in state, you can just use them in shader programs.

!! Built-in matrices

Matrices (float4x4) supported:

: ``UNITY_MATRIX_MVP`` : Current model*view*projection matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_MV`` : Current model*view matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_V`` : Current view matrix.
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_P`` : Current projection matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_VP`` : Current view*projection matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_T_MV`` : Transpose of model*view matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_IT_MV`` : Inverse transpose of model*view matrix
: ``UNITY_MATRIX_TEXTURE0`` to ``UNITY_MATRIX_TEXTURE3`` : Texture transformation matrices

!! Built-in vectors

Vectors (float4) supported:

: ``UNITY_LIGHTMODEL_AMBIENT`` : Current ambient color.
