__Note:__ it is recommended to minimize your references to external libraries, because 1 MB of .NET CIL code roughly translates to 3-4 MB of ARM code. For example, if your application references System.dll and System.Xml.dll then it means additional 6 MB of ARM code __if stripping is not used__. At some point application will reach limit when linker will have troubles linking the code.
If you care a lot about application size you might find C# a more suitable language for your code as is has less dependencies than JavaScript.
