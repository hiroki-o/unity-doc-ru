! How do I import Models from my 3D app?

To import a 3D model into Unity you can drag a file into the project window.

In the inspector > Model tab
Unity supports importing models from most popular 3D applications.

!!Textures

* Store textures in a folder called $$Textures$$ next to the exported mesh within your unity project. This will enable Unity to find the Texture and automatically connect the Texture to the generated Material. For more information, see the [[class-Texture2D|Textures]] reference.
