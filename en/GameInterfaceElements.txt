! Game Interface Elements

Unity gives you a number of options for creating your game's graphic user interface (GUI).  You can use [[class-GuiText | GUI Text]] and [[class-GuiTexture | GUI Texture]] objects in the scene, or generate the interface from scripts using $$UnityGUI$$.

The rest of this page contains a detailed guide for getting up and running with UnityGUI.
