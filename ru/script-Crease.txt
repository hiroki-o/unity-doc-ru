! Crease

The $$Crease$$ is a common non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering technique that enhances the visibility of objects by adding outlines of variable thickness.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
