!Animation Transitions

$$Animation Transitions$$ define ''what'' happens when you switch from one $$Animation State$$ to another. There can be only one transition active at any given time. 

||PROPS
||``Atomic``      ||Is this transition atomic? (cannot be interrupted)
||``Conditions``    ||Here we decide ''when'' transitions get triggered. 

A condition consists of:

* An event parameter or an ``Exit Time``, specifying a number which represents the normalized time of the source state (e.g. 0.95 means the transition will trigger, when we've played the source clip 95% through). 
* A conditional predicate, if needed (for example ``Less``/``Greater`` for floats). 
* A parameter value (if needed).

You can adjust the transition between the two animation clips by dragging the start and end values of the overlap.
