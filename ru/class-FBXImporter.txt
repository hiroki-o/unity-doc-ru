!Importing models

There are three tabs in the Model Importer - Model, Rig, and Animations.

* The Model tab has settings for importing the 3D model.
* The Rig tab has settings which will allow this 3D model to support animation.
* The Animations tab has settings for importing one or more Animation Clips from this model file.

This section covers these tabs in greater detail.
