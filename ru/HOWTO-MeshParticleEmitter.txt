! How do I make a Mesh Particle Emitter? (Legacy Particle System)

$$Mesh Particle Emitters$$ are generally used when you need high control over where to emit particles.

For example, when you want to create a flaming sword:

# Drag a mesh into the scene.
# Remove the ``Mesh Renderer`` by right-clicking on the ``Mesh Renderer's`` $$Inspector$$ title bar and choose ``Remove Component``.
# Choose ^^Mesh Particle Emitter^^ from the ^^Component->Effects->Legacy Particles^^ menu.
# Choose ^^Particle Animator^^ from the ^^Component->Effects->Legacy Particles^^ menu.
# Choose ^^Particle Renderer^^ from the ^^Component->Effects->Legacy Particles^^ menu.

You should now see particles emitting from the mesh.

Play around with the values in the [[class-MeshParticleEmitter|Mesh Particle Emitter]].

Especially enable ``Interpolate Triangles`` in the Mesh Particle Emitter Inspector and set ``Min Normal Velocity`` and ``Max Normal Velocity`` to 1.

To customize the look of the particles that are emitted:

# Choose ^^Assets->Create->Material^^ from the menu bar.
# In the Material Inspector, select ^^Particles->Additive^^ from the shader drop-down.
# Drag & drop a texture from the $$Project view$$ onto the texture slot in the Material Inspector.
# Drag the Material from the Project View onto the Particle System in the $$Scene View$$.

You should now see textured particles emitting from the mesh.
