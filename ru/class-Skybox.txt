||``Material`` ||The $$Material$$ used to render the Skybox, which contains 6 $$Textures$$. This Material should use the Skybox Shader, and each of the textures should be assigned to the proper global direction. ||


!! Details

Skyboxes are rendered before anything else in the scene in order to give the impression of complex scenery at the horizon. They are a box of 6 textures, one for each primary direction (+/-X, +/-Y, +/-Z).

You have two options for implementing Skyboxes.  You can add them to an individual [[class-Camera|Camera]] (usually the main Camera) or you can set up a default Skybox in [[class-RenderSettings|Render Settings's]] ``Skybox Material`` property.  The [[class-RenderSettings | Render Settings]] is most useful if you want all Cameras in your scene to share the same Skybox.

Adding the Skybox $$Component$$ to a Camera is useful if you want to override the default Skybox set up in the Render Settings.  E.g. You might have a split screen game using two Cameras, and want the Second camera to use a different Skybox.  To add a Skybox Component to a Camera, click to highlight the Camera and go to ^^Component->Rendering->Skybox^^.

Unity's Standard Assets contain 2 pre-setup Skybox materials in ^^Standard Assets->Skyboxes^^.

!! Hints

* If you have a Skybox assigned to a Camera, make sure to set the Camera's ``Clear mode`` to Skybox.
* It's a good idea to match your Fog color to the skybox's color. Fog color can be set in [[class-RenderSettings | Render Settings]].
