! Audio Chorus Filter (PRO only)

The $$Audio Chorus Filter$$ takes an [[class-AudioClip | Audio Clip]] and processes it creating a chorus effect. 

The chorus effect modulates the original sound by a sinusoid low frequency oscillator (LFO).  The output sounds like there are multiple sources emitting the same sound with slight variations - resembling a choir.

!! Adding a chorus filter
To add a chorus filter to a given audio source just select the object in the inspector and then select ``Component->Audio->Audio Chorus Filter``.

!! Hints
* You can tweak the chorus filter to create a flanger effect by lowering the feedback and decreasing the delay, as the flanger is a variant of the chorus.
* Creating a simple, dry echo is done by setting ``Rate`` and ``Depth`` to 0 and tweaking the mixes and ``Delay``
