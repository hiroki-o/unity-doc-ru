! Importing Objects From Cheetah3D

Unity natively imports Cheetah3D files. To get started, simply place your __.jas__ file in your project's Assets folder.
When you switch back into Unity, the scene is imported automatically and will show up in the $$Project View$$.

To see your model in Unity, simply drag it from the Project View into the $$Scene View$$.

If you modify your __.jas__ file, Unity will automatically update whenever you save.

!! Unity currently imports from Cheetah3D

# All nodes with position, rotation and scale. Pivot points and Names are also imported.
# Meshes with vertices, polygons, triangles, UV's and Normals.
# Animations.
# Materials with diffuse color and textures.

!! Requirements
* You need to have at least Cheetah3D 2.6 installed.
