! How do I use Detail Textures?

A $$Detail texture$$ is a small, fine pattern which is faded in as you approach a surface, for example wood grain, imperfections in stone, or earthly details on a terrain.  They are explicitly used with the [[shader-NormalDiffuseDetail | Diffuse Detail shader]].

Detail textures must tile in all directions. Color values from 0-127 makes the object it's applied to darker, 128 doesn't change anything, and lighter colors make the object lighter. It's very important that the image is centered around 128 - otherwise the object it's applied to will get lighter or darker as you approach.

# Save the image next to your main texture.
# In Unity, select the image and under "Generate Mip Maps", enable ``Fades Out`` and set the sliders to something like this in the $$Import Settings$$ in the $$Inspector$$.
# The top slider determines how small the texture should before before beginning to fade out, and the bottom determines how far away it is before the detail texture completely disapear.\\
