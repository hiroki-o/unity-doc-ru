''Console in the editor.''

The Console shows messages, warnings, errors, or debug output from your game. You can define your own messages to be sent to the Console using ^^Debug.Log()^^, ^^Debug.LogWarning^^, or ^^Debug.LogError()^^.  You can double-click any message to be taken to the script that caused the message.  You also have a number of options on the Console Toolbar.
