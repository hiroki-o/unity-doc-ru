! Twirl

The $$Twirl$$ image effect distorts the rendered image within a circular region. The pixels at the centre of the circle are rotated by a specified angle; the rotation for other pixels in the circle decreases with distance from the centre, diminishing to zero at the circle's edge.

Twirl is similar to another image effect called [[script-VortexEffect|Vortex]], although vortex distorts the image around a central circle rather than a single point.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
