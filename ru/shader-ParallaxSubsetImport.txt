!! Parallax Normal mapped Properties

$$Parallax Normal mapped$$ is the same as regular $$Normal mapped$$, but with a better simulation of "depth".  The extra depth effect is achieved through the use of a $$Height Map$$.  The Height Map is contained in the alpha channel of the Normal map. In the alpha, black is zero depth and white is full depth. This is most often used in bricks/stones to better display the cracks between them.

The Parallax mapping technique is pretty simple, so it can have artifacts and unusual effects. Specifically, very steep height transitions in the Height Map should be avoided.  Adjusting the ``Height`` value in the $$Inspector$$ can also cause the object to become distorted in an odd, unrealistic way.  For this reason, it is recommended that you use gradual Height Map transitions or keep the ``Height`` slider toward the shallow end.
