This shader is a $$Pixel-Lit$$ shader, which is more expensive than $$Vertex-Lit$$.  Pixel lighting is expensive mostly because each object has to be drawn multiple times for each pixel light that shines on it. Vertex lights don't affect the shader in this way. Pixel lights support cookies, normal mapping, and shadows while vertex lights do not. Pixel lights are also much less sensitive to tesselation of the models - if you have a cube using this shader, you can put point light very close to its surface and it will have nice round highlight.  This effect cannot be achieved with Vertex lighting.
