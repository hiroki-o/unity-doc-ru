!Colors and Gradients in the Particle System (Shuriken)

Attach:ShurikenColorProperty.png
For properties that deal with color, the ``Particle System`` makes use of the $$Color and Gradient Editor$$. 
It works in a similar way to the [[ParticleSystemCurveEditor |Curve Editor]].

The color-based properties will have a pull down menu on the right hand side, where you can choose between: 

``Gradient``: The gradient (RGBA) will vary throughout time, edited in the [[GradientEditor|Gradient Editor]]

``Random Between Two Gradients``: The gradient (RGBA) varies with time and is chosen at random between two values specified [[GradientEditor|Gradient Editor]]
