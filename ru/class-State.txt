!Animation States

$$Animation States$$ are the basic building blocks of an $$Animation State Machine$$. Each state contains an individual animation sequence (or [[AnimationBlendTrees|blend tree]]) which will play while the character is in that state. When an event in the game triggers a state transition, the character will be left in a new state whose animation sequence will then take over.

When you select a state in the ~~Animator Controller~~, you will see the properties for that state in the inspector:-

||PROPS
||``Speed``      ||The default speed of the animation||
||``Motion``     ||The animation clip assigned to this state||
||``Foot IK``    ||Should Foot IK be respected for this state||
||``Transitions``||The list of transitions originating from this state||

The default state, displayed in brown, is the state that the machine will be in when it is first activated. You can change the default state, if necessary, by right-clicking on another state and selecting ^^Set As Default^^ from the context menu. The ''solo'' and ''mute'' checkboxes on each transition are used to control the behaviour of $$animation previews$$ - see [[AnimationSoloMute|this page]] for further details.

A new state can be added by right-clicking on an empty space in the ~~Animator Controller Window~~ and selecting ^^Create State->Empty^^ from the context menu. Alternatively, you can drag an animation into the Animator Controller Window to create a state containing that animation. (Note that you can only drag Mecanim animations into the Controller - non-Mecanim animations will be rejected.) States can also contain [[Main.AnimationBlendTrees|Blend Trees]].

!!!Any State
$$Any State$$ is a special state which is always present. It exists for the situation where you want to go to a specific state regardless of which state you are currently in. This is a shorthand way of adding the same outward transition to all states in your machine. Note that the special meaning of $$Any State$$ implies that it cannot be the end point of a transition (ie, jumping to "any state" cannot be used as a way to pick a random state to enter next).
