! How do I Use Normal Maps?

$$Normal maps$$ are grayscale images that you use as a height map on your objects in order to give an appearance of raised or recessed surfaces. Assuming you have a model that looks like this:

Attach:Bumpmap1.png\\
''The 3D Model''

Attach:Bumpmap2.png\\
''The Texture''

We want to make the light parts of the object appear raised.

# Draw a grayscale height map of your texture in Photoshop. White is high, black is low. Something like this: [[<<]] Attach:Bumpmap3.png

# Save the image next to your main texture.
# In Unity, select the image and select the 24 bit RGB format and enable ``Generate Normal Map`` in the $$Import Settings$$ in the $$Inspector$$: [[<<]] 
\\

# In the $$Material Inspector$$ of your model, select 'Bumped Diffuse' from the Shader drop-down: [[<<]] Attach:Bumpmap5.png

# Drag your texture from the Project window to the 'Normalmap' texture slot: [[<<]] Attach:Bumpmap6.png

Your object now has a normal map applied:

!!Hints
* To make the bumps more noticable, either use the Bumpyness slider in the Texture Import Settings or blur the texture in Photoshop. Experiment with both approaches to get a feel for it.
