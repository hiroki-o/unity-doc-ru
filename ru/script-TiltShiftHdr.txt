! Tilt Shift

$$Tilt Shift$$ is a local blur effect that blurs the image based on distance to the center. It comes in two modes: ``TiltShift`` and ``Iris``. The following screenshots demonstrate the difference.

''Tilt shift mode: vertical defocus''

''Iris mode: radial defocus''

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
