! Sepia Tone

The $$Sepia Tone$$ image effect tints an image to resemble an old photograph.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.
