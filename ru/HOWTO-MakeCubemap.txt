!How do I Make a Cubemap Texture?

$$Cubemaps$$ are used by the [[shader-ReflectiveFamily | Reflective built-in shaders]]. To build one, you either create six 2D textures and create a new Cubemap asset, or build the Cubemap from a single square texture. More details are in the [[class-Cubemap|Cubemap Texture]] documentation page.

Static and dynamic cubemap reflections can also be rendered from scripts. Code example in [[ScriptRef:Camera.RenderToCubemap.html | Camera.RenderToCubemap]] page contains a simple wizard script for rendering cubemaps straight from the editor.
