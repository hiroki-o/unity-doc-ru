! Audio High Pass Filter (PRO only)

The $$Audio High Pass Filter$$ passes high frequencies of an AudioSource and cuts off signals with frequencies lower than the ``Cutoff Frequency``.\\
The ``Highpass resonance Q`` (known as Highpass Resonance Quality Factor) determines how much the filter's self-resonance is dampened. Higher ``Highpass resonance Q`` indicates a lower rate of energy loss i.e. the oscillations die out more slowly.
