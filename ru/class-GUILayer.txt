! GUI Layer

A $$GUI Layer$$ Component is attached to a Camera to enable rendering of 2D GUIs.

When a GUI Layer is attached to a Camera it will render all [[class-GuiTexture|GUI Textures]] and [[class-GuiText|GUI Texts]] in the scene.  GUI Layers do not affect [[GUI Scripting Guide | UnityGUI]] in any way.

You can enable and disable rendering GUI in a single camera by clicking on the check box of the GUI Layer in the $$Inspector$$.
