__Please Note__: Unity 2.0 introduced $$UnityGUI$$, a GUI Scripting system.  You may prefer creating user interface elements with UnityGUI instead of GUI Texts.  Read more about how to use UnityGUI in the [[GUI Scripting Guide]].

||PROPS
||``Text``     ||The string to display. ||
||``Anchor``   ||The point at which the ``Text`` shares the position of the $$Transform$$. ||
||``Alignment``    ||How multiple lines are aligned within the $$GUIText$$. ||
||``Pixel Offset`` ||Offset of the text relative to the position of the GUIText in the screen.||
||``Line Spacing`` ||How much space will be in-between lines of ``Text``. ||
||``Tab Size`` ||How much space will be inserted for a tab ('\t') character. As a multiplum of the space character offset. ||
||``Font``     ||The [[class-Font|Font]] to use when rendering the text. ||
||``Material`` ||Reference to the $$Material$$ containing the characters to be drawn. If set, this property overrides the one in the [[class-Font|Font]] asset. ||
||``Font Size``     ||The font size to use.  Set to 0 to use the default font size. Only applicable for dynamic fonts. ||

!! Details

GUI Texts are used to print text onto the screen in 2D. The $$Camera$$ has to have a [[class-GUILayer|GUI Layer]] attached in order to render the text.  Cameras include a GUI Layer by default, so don't remove it if you want to display a GUI Text.  GUI Texts are positioned using only the X and Y axes.  Rather than being positioned in World Coordinates, GUI Texts are positioned in Screen Coordinates, where (0,0) is the bottom-left and (1,1) is the top-right corner of the screen

To import a font see the [[class-Font|Font page]].

To use Rich Text see the [[StyledText |Rich Text page]].


!!! Pixel Correct

By default, GUI Texts are rendered with ``Pixel Correct`` enabled. This makes them look crisp and they will stay the same size in pixels independent of the screen resolution.

!!Hints
* When entering text into the ``Text`` property, you can create a line break by holding ^^Alt^^ and pressing ^^Return^^.
* If you are scripting the ``Text`` property, you can add line breaks by inserting the escape character "\n" in your strings.
* You can download free true type fonts from [[http://www.1001freefonts.com/fonts/afonts.htm|1001freefonts.com]] (download the Windows fonts since they contain TrueType fonts).
