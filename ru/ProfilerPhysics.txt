!!Physics Area

The Physics area shows the following statistics about the physics in the scene:-
* ``Active Rigidbodies`` is the number of rigidbodies that are not currently sleeping (ie, they are moving or just coming to rest).
* ``Sleeping Rigidbodies`` is the number of rigidbodies that are completely at rest and therefore don't need to be updated actively by the physics engine (see [[Rigidbody Sleeping]] for further details).
* ``Number of Contacts`` is the total number of points of contact between all colliders in the scene.
* ``Static Colliders`` is the number of colliders attached to non-rigidbody objects (ie, objects which never move under physics).
* ``Dynamic Colliders`` is the number of colliders attached to rigidbody objects (ie, objects which do move under physics).
